## Observed false positives

Encoded PowerShell was observed during legitimate activity.

Common sources:
- Software deployment scripts
- Internal automation
- Development tools
- Remote management software

Encoded execution by itself should not be alerted on.

Useful ways to reduce noise:
- Baseline scheduled activity
- Look at execution time patterns
- Review parent process
- Focus on user initiated execution

Context mattered more than encoding.
